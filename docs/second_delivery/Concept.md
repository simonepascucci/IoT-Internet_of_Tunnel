# Concept

## Brief Description

Our project aims to employ a network of sensors and actuators to automate the management and monitoring of air quality and lighting conditions inside car galleries. We aim to offer a remote tool that enables real-time monitoring and usage, providing a convenient means for continuous surveillance and utilization.  
The goal of this section is to provide users with a comprehensive overview of the smart tunnel, describing the system usage from their point of view.

## Tunnel operator point of view

### Deployment

To work properly, a set of sensors and actuators needs to be deployed inside the tunnel. To enable monitoring and management, it is essential that these units establish a direct connection to the board.  
The following schema provides a high level overview on how the components must be connected together.

### Monitoring and usage

The operators in charge of monitoring and utilization of the smart tunnel system will have access to a web app from which he will be able to perform these operations.  
The web app allows the operator to monitoring the data collected by the sensors, and to perform specific measurements on demand. This means that the operator is able change the measurement frequency rate and timing.  
This system also allows the operator to remotely control the actuators.  
The regulamentation for defining the designated individual in charge to perform these actions will follow the rules of the specific tunnel ordinance.

## Tunnel user point of view

The entire system should operate seamlessly and without any noticeable impact on the regular users of the tunnels, including cars, motorcycles, and pedestrians. Transparency is key, ensuring that the system functions discreetly without causing disruption or inconvenience to those utilizing the tunnels.  
The normal users should only benefit of a more controlled and clean air.
