# Concept

## Brief Description

Our project is designed to automatically manage and monitor the air quality and lighting conditions in a car gallery.  
To use the system, an operator simply need to install the IoT sensors in the car gallery and connect them to the system's hub.  
Once the sensors are connected, they will begin collecting data on the air quality and lighting levels in the gallery.  
Based on the data collected, the system will automatically activate the lights and fans to maintain optimal conditions inside the gallery.  
In addition, the data collected by the sensors will be tracked and transmitted to a remote server, where they will be available for  
use in generating analyses and statistical data.

## Impact

Improving the overall air quality and light conditions inside the gallery, this project aims to reach two main goals:

- Reducing the overall number of car accidents inside the tunnel.
- Facilitate the use of the tunnel by pedestrians, where applicable.

In addition, the system is designed to use the various components only when necessary, allowing efficient use of energy.
