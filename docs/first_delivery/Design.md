## High level architecture

![High Level Srchitecture](/docs/src/images/high_level_architecture.JPG)  
As shown in the picture, a set of sensors and actuators, grouped together in small clusters, are connected with an ESP32 controller.  
Based on the data received from the sensors, the controller manages the actuators by managing the speed/intensity and the switch-on state.

## Components

### Sensors

- Light sensor
- Air quality sensor

### Actuators

- Fan system
- Lightening system

## Network

## Web server
