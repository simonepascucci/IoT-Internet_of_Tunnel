# Evaluation

## Overview

The IoT project is designed to monitor air quality and light levels inside a tunnel. Some air quality sensors and some photoresistor are used to collect data in real-time. The system is connected to some actuators that activates the fan system when the air quality decreases below a certain threshold, and the lighting system that turn on independently when the light levels fall below a certain value.

## Performance evaluation metrics

### Accuracy

The accuracy of the system is a key performance metric. The solution in question, must accurately measure and detect changes in air quality and light levels.
The overall values detected must remain inside a defined range to consider the solution effective.

### Responsiveness

The responsiveness of the system is also important. The system should respond to changes in air quality and light levels, to ensure the correct functioning, also in case of emergency situations.
One way to evaluate this parameter would be to expose it to specific changes in air quality and light levels and measure the time it takes to reach the predefined range after these changes.

## Expected results

As mentioned before, to consider the system effective, the overall values detected must remain below a defined treshold. We therefore expect that our system is capable of managing different traffic situations and lightning conditions by keeping the values in question inside the correct ranges.  
As a prerequisite for achieving this behaviour, we expect the accuracy of the system to be good enough to allow the system to detect and react to specific situations and requirements in a reasonable amount of time.

As a consequence, we expect a decrease in the number of car accident inside the gallery and a more efficient power management.
