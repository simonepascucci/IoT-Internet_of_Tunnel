# Evaluation

## Overview
The IoT project is designed to monitor air quality and light levels under a tunnel. Some air quality sensors and some photoresistor are used to collect data in real-time. The system is connected to some actuators that activates the fan system when the air quality decreases below a certain threshold, and the lighting system that turn on independently when the light levels fall below a certain value.

## Performance evaluation metrics

### Accuracy

The accuracy of the system is a key performance metric. The project must accurately measure and detect changes in air quality and light levels. 

To evaluate accuracy, the system must be tested against a calibrated instrument, such as a reference air quality monitoring station, and a lux meter for light levels. 

### Responsiveness

The responsiveness of the system is also critical. The system should respond to changes in air quality and light levels, to ensure the correct functioning also in case of emergency situations.

To evaluate responsiveness, the system must be tested by exposing it to sudden changes in air quality and light levels. The average response time and the time it takes to reach a stable state after a change must be measured.

### Energy Efficiency

The energy efficiency of the system is an important performance metric in IoT projects. Since the system runs continuously, it must be designed to consume minimal energy.

To evaluate energy efficiency, the power consumption of the system must be measured in different states, such as standby and active states.

## Expected results

- The accuracy of the system will be verified by comparing the data collected by the system with that of a reference air quality monitoring station and a lux meter for light levels. The results will show that the system had an error rate of less than a certain percentage value.

- The responsiveness of the system will be tested by subjecting it to sudden changes in air quality and light levels. The system should respond within a few seconds, and the time taken to reach a stable state after a change will be less than one minute in order to have us sufficently satisfied with the result.

- Finally, the energy efficiency of the system will be measured by monitoring power consumption in standby mode and active mode.
